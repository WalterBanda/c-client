/// ### `ðŸ“–` About this validator
/// This is a validator class responsible for all validation
/// concerning users input from input fields to other methods of input
///
/// It contains various methods that are responsible for validation,
/// Most validations are powered by [Regex] `ðŸ˜¸ For those who fear [Regex] dont worry
/// there are explainations for them`
///
///  #### ðŸ’¡ Validator Methods
///  These are the methods provided
///  - [validateName] - Responsible for validating Usernames, relatively simple
///  - [validateEmail] - Handles email validation, powered by [Regex], read the fn docs to know how it works
/// - [validatePassword] - Handles password validation, just a simple check to see if the password passes lenght requirement
/// - [validatePhone] - Handles phone validation, powered by [Regex], read the fn docs to know
/// - [validateAddress] - Handles validation of location, check fn docs to see more details

  /// `ðŸ“–` [validateEmail]
  ///
  /// This is responsible for email validation on the user string
  /// It uses [RegExp] to accomplish this, `more on it will be explained below`
  /// There are only two [Error] states
  ///  - One when there is no input results in 'Email can't be empty'
  ///  - One when there is no match results in 'Enter a correct email'
  ///
  /// I know you are scared of regex, let me explain the Regex `^((\w+(?!.*[.\s]{2})[\w!#$%&'*+-=?^_'{|}~.]+)?\w+)@(([a-zA-Z0-9]+[\w-]*(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,}))$` below
  ///
  /// `ðŸ’¡` How it works
  ///
  /// The regular expression `^((\w+(?!.*[.\s]{2})[\w!#$%&'*+-=?^_'{|}~.]+)?\w+)@(([a-zA-Z0-9]+[\w-]*(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,}))$` checks whether a given string is a valid email address or not according to some common email standards such as IETF standards.
  /// Here is how the expression is working:
  ///
  ///  - `^` and `$` match the start and end of the string, respectively. This ensures that the entire string is matched and there are no extra characters before or after the email address.
  ///  - `(\w+(?!.*[.\s]{2})[\w!#$%&'*+-=?^_'{|}~.]+)?` matches the local part of the email address. It starts with one or more word characters `(\w+)` and optionally followed by one or more special characters that are allowed in the local part of an email address according to IETF standards. The negative lookahead `(?!.*[.\s]{2})` ensures that there are no consecutive dots or spaces in the local part of the email address.
  ///  - `\w+` matches the last word character in the local part of the email address, which must be present in any valid email address.
  ///  - `@` matches the "@" symbol, which separates the local and domain parts of the email address.
  ///  - `(([a-zA-Z0-9]+[\w-]*(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,}))` matches the domain part of the email address. It starts with one or more alphanumeric characters followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or dots. This is followed by a dot and a top-level domain name consisting of two or more alphabets. The domain part may have one or more subdomains separated by dots.
